# OwnTracks Tools

This is a fork of the original repository (https://github.com/owntracks/tools) just to update the script to import Google locations.

### Google/import-location-history.py
Reads a JSON export of Google Location History from
[Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout) and publishes all of its locations
to MQTT. Useful for importing Google Location History into OwnTracks Recorder
